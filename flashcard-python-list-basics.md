  - title: Why We Need Data Structures
    description: "Data structures are essential for storing multiple values efficiently. Without them, operations like adding or removing values become cumbersome."
    
  - title: Storing Values Without Data Structures
    description: "Without lists, each student's mark would require a separate variable, making calculations inefficient."
    
  - title: Using Lists to Store Multiple Values
    description: "Lists simplify storage and computation. With functions like `sum()` and `len()`, operations become straightforward."
    
  - title: Operations On List Data Structure
    description: "Lists in Python are versatile. You can create, analyze, add/remove elements, search, and iterate through them."

  - title: Creating and Analyzing a List
    description: "Create lists using `[]`. Analyze with `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`, and `len()`."

  - title: Adding and Removing Elements
    description: "Use `append()` to add at the end, `insert()` for specific positions, and `remove()` to delete values."

  - title: Searching and Checking Existence
    description: "Check existence with `in`. Find index with `index()`. Note: Finding the index of a non-existent value results in an error."

  - title: Iterating Through a List
    description: "Use `for` loops to iterate through list values."

  - title: Puzzles With List Of Strings
    description: "Lists can hold strings. You can create, access elements, handle errors, delete, extend, and append to them."

  - title: Handling List Errors
    description: "Accessing an out-of-range index results in `IndexError`."

  - title: Extending and Appending to a List
    description: "Use `extend()` to add multiple elements, and `append()` to add single elements."

  - title: Fun Facts About Lists
    description: "Python lists are versatile and dynamic. They support negative indexing and can store different data types."

  - title: Sorting, Looping, and Reversing Lists
    description: "Manipulate lists using `reverse()`, `sort()`, and loop through them in various ways."

  - title: Reversing a List
    description: "Use `reverse()` for in-place reversal. Loop in reverse with `reversed()`."

  - title: Sorting a List
    description: "Sort in-place with `sort()`. Access sorted elements with `sorted()`. Use custom logic with the `key` argument."
